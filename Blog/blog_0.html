        <p style="font-weight:bold;font-size:32px;"><span style="font-size:20.8px;float:right;text-align:right;">Blog #1<br>March 31, 2013</span>About Me</p>
        <p>On Java-Gaming.org there was a topic <a href="http://www.java-gaming.org/topics/what-have-been-are-your-learning-techniques/29119/view.html">here</a> that asked all about you as a programmer.  I reponded, then deemed my response as good enough to put as my first blog ever.  This is edited slightly to further develop the stories I talk about here.</p>

          <span style="font-weight:bold;">- Why did you want to start programming? (What was your motivation?)</span>
          <br>
		  I learned Scratch during the summer of 2011 in a 2-day class because each summer I go to a class with my grandparents where you and they learn about a topic.  That year I picked Computer Science because I had always been rather fond of computers.  After making a pretty good zombie game in Scratch that you can check out <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/Sammidysam/2342918">here</a>, I bought the first Humble Bundle Mojam.  In it was a game called Catacomb Snatch by Mojang and it had a game-crashing NullPointerException.  Jeb posted an article on how to set up a workplace to fix the bug and improve the rest of the game yourself, so I decided to try to do so.  Upon looking at the code though, I realized that it wouldn't be very easy at all.  From there I started doing console work and slowly worked my way up in the normal programmer way to do so.  I was also motivated by Minecraft, as I made a mod that was really bad in it a month or two into learning that you can check out <a href="http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1106043-125-wolves-vs-skeletons-ssp/">here</a>.  In the end I never worked on Catacomb Snatch at all.  I'm also probably never going back to Minecraft just for fun; making my own games is much more fun for me.  I am not ruling out looking at the code to get an idea of how it works and all though.  Creating a game like it could be fun.

          <span style="font-weight:bold;">- Why did you choose to begin with the language you begun with? And if applicable, why are you using the language you are using now?</span>
          <br>
          I chose Java mainly because Minecraft is programmed in Java, but also because Catacomb Snatch is and I wanted to edit it.  I use Java now because C++ seems a lot more complicated than it needs to be and my friend who uses C++ informs me about how C# is not easily multi-platform which makes it hard to get your programs out there.  I will use it for programs of mine that I only need to run on Windows, though.  Those are far and few between so not I end up not using C# a lot.  I am slowly trying to learn C++ now, even though it's more complicated than it needs to be.  I also know C#.  I felt right at home working with C# after learning Java.  I have made stuff in Python as well, though I wouldn't say I really know the language.  I also test out new languages from time to time because I always want to explore what else I can do in programming.  I also am using F# for a current project, but I am really bad with that language.  Nonetheless, since I have used it, I will put it on my list of most used languages by me.  I will base this list off of the number of projects I have used each language for.  Tiebreakers are how much I like the language.  This is that list:  <br>1. Java<br>2. C#<br>3. C++<br>4. Python<br>5. F#

		  <span style="font-weight:bold;">- How long ago did you get started? And where are you at now?</span>
		  <br>
		  I started Java in February of 2012.  I learned C# in early December of 2012, and started learning C++ in early January of 2013.  I've been progressing extremely slowly with C++ and will likely wait until July when I am going to take a small class on C++ to really get into the language.  I'm using it for OpenGL 3D tests right now, and will likely just use it to test OpenGL concepts in the future.  Some may say that's a horrible use for C++, but I think it's a great use because C++ has great OpenGL support.  In the far future, maybe next year, I may even make a game in C++.

		  Now I am currently making two games and editing one.  I am making a strategy game currently called USStrategy and PixelZombies.  I am also transferring the code of my first game, HungerGamesBoardGame, to OOP, as I didn't quite understand the concept upon making the game.  Now I fully grasp OOP, so I will use it to its extend in all my future games.  Currently in the process of making PixelZombies I am fixing its code, as it is not very OOP either.  After I fix PixelZombies' code, I can finish the game pretty quickly.  After I finish it, I will probably work on my strategy game more and then maybe start working on a side-scroller.  In terms of libraries and other miscellaneous programs, I made a GamePatcher library that will help you in making launchers for your games in Java and C#.  I use it in launchers for the games HungerGamesBoardGame and PixelZombies and it works extremely well.  The Java version is a lot better however since I haven't updated the C# version as much as the Java version.  I also made a bridge simulator program in C# for a science project at the end of 2012.  It worked very well except for that the SmartBoard, which is a big touchscreen device used at my school, didn't activate the mouse click method and that made me have to direct someone over at the computer with what to do.  It was a disappointing bug that I forgot to test for.  You can see more of my projects at <a href="https://github.com/Sammidysam">my GitHub page</a>.  I put most anything of value onto GitHub.

		  <span style="font-weight:bold;">- What learning methods did you employ personally to help you develop your skills in programming?</span>
		  <br>
		  Whenever I get a problem, I go to Google.  My way is probably not a very good way to go.  If I had done it and started out with C++, I probably wouldn't be programming because I would've gotten so confused.  It works very well for Java however.
		</p>
		<p>
		  <span style="font-weight:bold;">- What advice could you give to other programmers who might be feeling a little lost in what direction to take?</span>
		  <br>
		  Usually the best way to know what to do next is to keep a list of projects you'd like to do and append new ideas to it whenever you think of one, even if you won't start working on it right away.  Then you can go to that list for all your ideas when you want to start a new project.  Where to get ideas for this list?  Friends that don't program are generally a good place because they can't make what they want in a video game themself so they will likely have ideas that they can quickly give you.  Most ideas of these will come from your own mind, however.  Many ideas can come from playing video games not made by yourself.  So if you can't think of what to program and have some free time, play some video games!  You could draw some inspiration from the games you play.

		  <span style="font-weight:bold;">- Is there anything you believe should be a "Rite of Passage" for programmers (such as the need to create hello world, or a snake program, etc etc).</span>
		  <br>
		  I feel like if starting a new language, at least start by printing <span style="font-style:italic;">something</span>.  It doesn't have to be "Hello, world!" but just something will do.  It's the best starting point to get going.  From there you can keep doing console work for awhile and eventually progress towards windowed applications and finally games.  For the most part, I do not believe there is a "rite of passage" for programming.
