		<p>Two weeks ago I used the <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/windows-installer">Wubi installer</a> to install Ubuntu 12.10 on my computer.  The previous time throughout that weekend I had been looking at Java operating system attempts.  I am a huge fan of Java, and if an operating system was written purely in Java, I would find a way to dual-boot even without a high class dual-boot installer like Wubi just for it.  It would be really cool to see a Java operating system.  I was primarily looking at <a href="http://www.jnode.org/">JNode</a> because it was by far the OS that had gotten the furthest (I think).  I tried for awhile to be able to modify it, but I never got anywhere.  Now I am just going to monitor <a href="https://github.com/tmyroadctfig/jnode">this copy of JNode</a> that actually gets updated every 2-3 weeks or so.  So JNode is still alive, and even though I can't program it myself, I'm excited to watch its progress.</p>
    <p>Back on the topic of the Wubi installer, I only considered installing Ubuntu 12.10 in the first place because of a friend of mine.  His GitHub account is <a href="https://github.com/four04">here</a>.  While I will tell many people that I actually got Linux on my computer to test multi-platform compatibility of my programs (which I do use it to do), his huge love of Linux led me to think about installing it.  Another huge reason thing that led me to installing Linux besides the previous two listed was back at the 2-day class during the summer that I mentioned in the last blog.  The computers at the class would display a box prompting you to choose your OS at startup and there were three options:  Windows, Mac, and Linux.  I thought that it was really cool that one computer could have three OSes on it (as at that time I never knew it was possible).  Now that fascination has evolved into a mini-dream of mine for the future:  once I am living on my own, I would like to build a desktop that runs the three major OSes Windows, Mac, and Linux.  It would be powerful enough to run all of the games or programs I create.  I would call it "The Testing Computer" with a definite emphasis on the word "the".  I feel like having this computer will allow me to test for multi-platform compatibility very well as it will have all of the major OSes installed on it.  If I decide, I could take it a step further and install about 6 or so OSes on it in order to test just about everything.  That could slow it down though, and I would need to maintain its ability to run all of the games and programs that I create.  I would also likely not use it for programming, unless I was modifying my programs that weren't working right.  I would probably use a Windows and Linux dual-boot (though it's a fake dual-boot in that I used the Wubi installer instead of disk partitions) like I am using today for programming.</p>
    <p>After installing Ubuntu 12.10, I had to install lots of programs.  Initially I found some things that I liked about Linux:  one being that you can install programs through the command line!  To the programmer that I am, this seems way easier than clicking lots of buttons that you have to in order to install programs in Windows.  I also was happy to find that you don't have to manually add pathes to the Path variable as often as in Windows.  In Windows, you have to do it so often that I was led to downloading <a href="http://www.redfernplace.com/software-projects/patheditor/">this program</a>.  The program is really helpful for editing the Windows Path variable, which sadly with Windows you have to do a lot.  A third thing that I like about Linux is that it comes with so many helpful programs--well, at least Ubuntu 12.10 does.  I am not sure about the other Linux distributions out there.  It came with <a href="https://live.gnome.org/Empathy">Empathy</a>, a chat program that allows me to not have to leave an internet browser open to leave myself logged into Gmail chat, and <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/">Mozilla Thunderbird</a>, a program similar to Microsoft's Outlook that provides email in a program but also has chat features.  I installed Mozilla Thunderbird on Windows on my computer after learning of it because of Linux.  Mozilla Thunderbird can combine Empathy and itself into one, but on Linux I use the two programs while on Windows I only use Thunderbird.  It is now really helpful and I like it a lot.  Linux is a really good operating system and in the future I may want to set up a real dual-boot on my computer with Windows 7 and some distribution of Linux.  During the summer I may actually do this.  You could suggest what distribution of Linux in the comments section below.  I will likely go to the same friend who led me to installing Linux in the first place, though.</p>
    <p>During the two weeks that I have had Linux, I have mainly used it to test multi-platform compatibility of my programs.  It is the main reason why I currently have it anyway.  Using Linux has resulted in many of my programs being more multi-platform.  It has resulted me stopping being ignorant enough to leave the directory separator char always being '\\' in my games and other multi-platform improvements.  It also has some default programs that are better than on Windows, such as gedit.  Gedit comes with syntax highlighting, tabs, and the possibility to word wrap.  Notepad on Windows comes with no syntax highlighting, no tabs, and possibly word wrap (I have not tested it).  Notepad on Windows is so bad that I one day replaced it with a really neat program called <a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a>.  If you understand the ++ operator in programming, the title makes complete sense.  If you don't, then ++ takes the value of a variable and makes it one higher.  So if the value of the variable Notepad (let's assume the variable is representing its usefulness) is 2, Notepad++ will equal 3.  So Notepad++ takes Notepad and makes it much better.  It does extremely well, and it is a very good program.  Now Windows thinks that Notepad++ is Notepad on my computer.  <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/12617/how-to-replace-notepad-in-windows-7/">This</a> is a good tutorial, the one that I used, on how to replace Notepad with Notepad++ on your Windows if you are motivated to get syntax highlighting and tabs in your text editor.  It's really not that important unless you are a programmer like me, however.  You can install Notepad++ and Notepad side by side though, so you may wonder why I felt the need to replace Notepad with Notepad++ completely.  I did so because it makes it a ton easier to use Notepad++ all the time instead of Notepad.  If I wanted to keep normal Notepad, I would have to change the default program for a lot of files, and it is just a lot simpler to replace the program completely.  I am now using the Linux program gedit to write this blog, as word wrap being on by default is perfect for this blog.  I remember that I wrote the first blog on Windows using Notepad++ with no word wrap and I had to write each paragraph on one line.  I didn't think of looking for word wrap.  It was a pretty stupid mistake.</p>
    <p>As I mentioned that I would love to see Java OSes in the past, I will introduce you to a new project my friend and I are going to work on.  This friend is not the same one as I mentioned earlier.  This friend is the same one that has done a very bad working with me on my game <a href="https://github.com/Sammidysam/USStrategy">USStrategy</a>.  He is getting highly motivated to learn Objective-C currently as he is in love with Apple--he is a huge Mac fanboy and is on his iPod Touch all the time.  Maybe this will improve the time he spends programming.  I am not sure how well he will be able to work on this project as he is a highly busy individual.  But nonetheless, he seemed interested in making this with me.  The idea is to make a Java OS, but not a real one.  This one will be "fake" in that instead of being a true OS, it will be an application that you double click and it will become fullscreen and be an OS just like that.  I have no idea what the menu layout will be at this time, but that is the idea of a project I am going to work on soon.  Likely the local drive for it will be in the same directory as the application.  It would do this by making a folder called "JavaDrive" or something and all of its files would be inside.  I'm really excited to work on this to see what I can do.  The first step of this project is to make a animation that plays when you run the application.  I want to base it off of the Steam Big Picture animation which you can see at the end of the video <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tovOurbxqY">here</a>.  I seek to build the GUI of the application to draw with both Java2D and LWJGL.  Then the user can decide which one they prefer when downloading.  Java2D will get special treatment because it is specially built for Java, even though it is horrible compared to LWJGL.  Honestly, the only reason why I want LWJGL as an option is because it is so much better than Java2D.  I look forward to this project.  If you want to work on this with me, leave a comment in the comments section below.  I will happily let many into working on this project with me.  It will be open source and will use GitHub for source-management.</p>
