		<h5>Description:</h5>
		<p>The first ever game programmed by Sammidysam, HungerGamesBoardGame takes a board game made by Sam Craig and Carson Ohland and transforms it into a video game.  HungerGamesBoardGame features 24-player matches with one player and 23 enemies.  Enemies have fully functional AI that will allow them to make decisions that are best for themselves.  To win the Hunger Games, you will need the perfect combination of luck and strategy.  You can not make alliances, so you are on your own to find a way to win.  The game primarily uses the mouse with a point and click system to click on buttons and decide what you'd like to do.  It's a completely free game, so try it out today!</p>
