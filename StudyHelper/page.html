		<h5>Description:</h5>
		<p>StudyHelper aids the evil process of studying by being random flash cards.  More exercises will come in the future, as this program is still in development.  Likely SDL will be used in the future so that accent marks do show up, as they normally don't in consoles.  Also consoles might turn some people off, and having a window instead might make them use the program more efficiently.  Also, I will likely make a launcher for this program in the future.  To ease the difficulty of making it, I will likely use Java for the launcher so that it won't take me days to build the launcher in C.  <span style="font-weight:bold;">Please note that the launcher currently is only guarenteed to work on Windows, it could fail on Linux or Mac!</span></p>
