		<h3 style="clear:both">About Me</h3>
		<p>This is a good mini-biography dealing with how I got started and whatnot.  It was written on March 30, 2013.  In the future I will probably make a different page; maybe make a mini-blog.</p>
		<p>
		  <span style="font-weight:bold;">- Why did you want to start programming? (What was your motivation?)</span>
		  <br>
		  I learned Scratch one summer in a 2/3-day class because I do some learning thing with your grandparents each summer and I picked Computer Science one year.  After making a pretty good zombie game in Scratch, I bought the first Humble Bundle Mojam.  In it was a game called Catacomb Snatch by Mojang and it was rather buggy.  Jeb posted an article on how to set up a workplace to fix the bugs yourself, so I decided to try to do so.  Upon looking at the code though, I realized that it wouldn't be very easy at all.  From there I started doing console stuff and slowly worked my way up.  I was also motivated by Minecraft, as I made a mod that sucked in it a month or two into learning.  In the end I never really worked on Catacomb Snatch at all.  I'm also probably never going back to Minecraft just for fun; making my own games is more fun for me.  I am not ruling out looking at the code to get an idea of how it works and all though.
		</p>
		<p>
		  <span style="font-weight:bold;">- Why did you choose to begin with the language you begun with? And if applicable, why are you using the language you are using now?</span>
		  <br>
		  I chose Java because Catacomb Snatch and Minecraft were programmed in Java.  I use Java now because C++ seems a lot more complicated for no use, and my friend who uses C++ harasses me if I use C# (not really, just tells me it's not multi-platform and that it is not good for programs).  Apparently it's not easily multi-platform which is upsetting for him since I use Windows and he Linux.  I am slowly trying to learn C++ now though.  I basically know C# since I know Java.  I felt right at home working with C# after learning Java.  I have made stuff in Python as well.  I'm going to work with F# likely today since I want to test it out and use it for a math study program.  But I use Java the majority of the time, C# next, then C++.  Python is very rare for me to use, but I do kind of like it.
		</p>
		<p>
		  <span style="font-weight:bold;">- How long ago did you get started? And where are you at now?</span>
		  <br>
		  I started Java in February of 2012.  Whoa, it's been over a year!  That's tremendous!  I learned C# in early December I believe, and started learning C++ in early January I believe.  I've been progressing extremely slowly however and I might just wait until July when I will likely take a class on C++ (my first ever programming class) to really get into it.  I'm planning on using it for 3D tests right now, and will likely just use it to test OpenGL concepts in the future.
		</p>
		<p>
          Now I am making two games, a strategy that my friend told me he would help me with but hasn't and PixelZombies.  I am also transferring my first game's code to OOP, as I didn't quite understand the concept upon making the game.  Now I fully grasp OOP, so I will use it to its extend in all my future games.  My first game is HungerGamesBoardGame, and it is pretty decent.  After I fix PixelZombies' code (it's not very OOP right now) and implement some new features I will likely start making a basic side-scroller.  In terms of libraries and other miscellaneous programs, I made a GamePatcher library that will help you in making launchers for your games (you can see these launchers at the topics for my two games) in Java and C#.  The Java version is a lot better however since I haven't updated the C# version as much as the Java version.  I also made a bridge simulator program in C# for a science project at the end of 2012.  It worked very well except for that the SmartBoard (big touchscreen) used in class didn't activate the mouse click method and that made me have to direct someone over at the computer with what to do.  It was a disappointing bug that I forgot to test for.  You can see more of my projects at <a href="https://github.com/Sammidysam">my GitHub page</a>.  I put most anything of value onto GitHub.

		  <span style="font-weight:bold;">- What learning methods did you employ personally to help you develop your skills in programming?</span>
		  <br>
		  Whenever I get a problem, I go to Google.  Then if I am stumped further, I make a topic here.  Though the latter barely ever happens.  My way is probably not a very good way to go.  If I had done it and started out with C++ I probably wouldn't be programming because I would've gotten so confused.
		</p>
		<p>
		  <span style="font-weight:bold;">- What advice could you give to other programmers who might be feeling a little lost in what direction to take?</span>
		  <br>
		  Talk to your friends (ideally those who play games and don't program) about what they want to see in a video game!  Or, in my case for my first game, take a board game that you and your friend made and translate it into a video game.
		</p>
		<p>
		  <span style="font-weight:bold;">- Is there anything you believe should be a "Rite of Passage" for programmers (such as the need to create hello world, or a snake program, etc etc).</span>
		  <br>
		  I feel like if starting a new language, at least start by printing <span style="font-style:italic;">something</span>.  It doesn't have to be "Hello world!" but just something will do.  It's the best starting point to get going.
