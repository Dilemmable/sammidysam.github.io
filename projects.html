  <h1>Projects</h1>
  <p>Below is a list of all of the programming projects that I have done.  In the future, some school-related stuff could be put there.  All projects are listed with the projects made first first and the projects made last last.  Feel free to click on the name of any project to get to a page with information about the project.</p>
  <p>The project pages are created in a way that is rather peculiar.  In the future I will link a blog post that will explain that.  Because of this, the year, month, and day subdirectories are in the URLs for the project pages.  These dates are <i>close</i> to the date of the creation of the project, but can be sometimes off.  Again, I will link a blog in the future explaining why.</p>
  
  <h2>Games</h2>
  <ul class="posts">
    {% for project in site.posts reversed %}
      {% if project.type == "game" %}
        <li>&raquo; <a href="{{ project.url }}">{{ project.title }}</a></li>
      {% endif %}
    {% endfor %}
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Other Creations</h2>
  <ul class="posts">
    {% for project in site.posts reversed %}
      {% if project.type == "other" %}
        <li>&raquo; <a href="{{ project.url }}">{{ project.title }}</a></li>
      {% endif %}
    {% endfor %}
</div>
